                <p>Mozambique’s total proven coal reserves at the end of 2016 were 25.6 Billion Tons. The reserve ranks
                    nine out of the 49 active producer countries of the world currently listed and is predicted to
                    contain enough coal for a further 200 years of mining given the most optimistic forecasts of growth
                    in the country’s coal industry.

                    The coking coal reserve at its potentially second largest mine Benga, owned and operated by the
                    International Coal Ventures of India consortium (ICVL) is reported to be the largest in Africa. That
                    and the 6.7 Billion Tons of the Tete coalfield – said to be one of the world’s largest – and over
                    which are Mozambique’s five largest mines, led to a government statement that the country could be
                    exporting 25% of the world’s coking coal by 2025 driven mainly by exports from Vale’s Moatize mine,
                    the country’s largest, to China and from the Benga mine to India.</p>

                    <p>Coal is a valuable commodity across the world. From the 1880s the most valued use for coal around
                        the
                        world has been to generate electricity. It is also used by the cement and steel industries as a
                        fuel
                        source to extract iron from iron ore and in the production of cement. In recent years it has
                        discovered that Botswana has over 200 billion tonnes of coal reserves and the development of the
                        coal industry has become a major priority. Mozambique is also expected to experience a sharp
                        increase in coal production towards 2020. It is estimated that its production could exceed 100
                        million tonnes in the period between 2015 and 2020.
